Guy in StackOverflow PHP chat recommended that I simply keep complete copies of the notes for versioning--KISS. I could
run a PHP diff implementation if I wanted to do fancy stuff later.



@NathanArthur What problem are you having exactly? Just splitting the text out into a separate table makes having different versions be 'trivial' like:

Note table
-noteId

NoteText table
-noteTextId
-text
-noteId

And then get the latest version of a note with:

select a.NoteId, b.text
   from Note a left join NoteText b
on
    a.noteId = b.noteId
order by
    b.noteTextId desc
limit 1
